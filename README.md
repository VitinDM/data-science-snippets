## Usage

To use the functions in this repository, simply import them into your Python script or Jupyter notebook. Hereâ€™s a basic example:

```python
from data_science_snippets import eda_helpers

# Load your DataFrame
import pandas as pd
df = pd.read_csv('your_data.csv')

# Use EDA function
eda_helpers.summarize_data(df)
```

Feel free to explore the functions available and adapt them to your specific needs.

## Functions Overview

### EDA Helpers

- **summarize_data(df)**: Provides a summary of the DataFrame, including statistics and data types.
- **visualize_missing_values(df)**: Displays a heatmap of missing values in the DataFrame.

### Data Cleaning Helpers

- **remove_duplicates(df)**: Removes duplicate rows from the DataFrame.
- **fill_missing_values(df, method)**: Fills missing values using specified methods (mean, median, mode).

### Feature Engineering Helpers

- **create_feature(df, feature_name, func)**: Creates a new feature based on a specified function.

### Model Evaluation Helpers

- **evaluate_model(y_true, y_pred)**: Calculates and returns common evaluation metrics.

### Time Series Helpers

- **resample_time_series(df, freq)**: Resamples a time series DataFrame to a specified frequency.

### Text Processing Helpers

- **clean_text(text)**: Cleans and preprocesses text data for analysis.
